# NeuroLeaks

**AI-powered secret detection for code commits using transformers and regex.**

NeuroLeaks combines traditional regex scanning with CodeBERT, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to detect secrets like API keys, passwords, tokens, and credentials — even when they're obfuscated or renamed.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neuroleaks.git
cd neuroleaks
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

> It's recommended to do this inside a virtual environment.

````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Using NeuroLeaks in Pre-commit

### Step 1: Install `pre-commit` (if you haven’t already)

````
pip install pre-commit
````

---

### Step 2: Reference NeuroLeaks in Your Project’s `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

````
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/markorskip/neuroleaks
    rev: main  # or use a specific tag like v0.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: neuroleaks
````

---

### Step 3: Install the Hook

From the root of your project:

````
pre-commit install
````

---

### Step 4: Run It Manually (Optional)

````
pre-commit run --all-files
````

You’ll get output like:

````
NeuroLeaks Secret Detection......................................❌
- [REGEX] Line 3: 'api_key = "AIzaSy123..."' matched api key pattern
- [ML]    Line 9: 'token = ghp_abcd1234...' (risk score: 0.91)
````

## Testing NeuroLeaks

NeuroLeaks includes a test suite to validate its ML and regex behavior.

### Run the tests

````
pytest tests/
````

## 🧠 How It Works

* **Regex Engine**: Scans added lines for common secret patterns (e.g., AWS keys, GitHub tokens, passwords).
* **Transformer Model**: Uses `microsoft/codebert-base` to assess whether a line is likely to contain a secret, even if it's obfuscated or renamed.
* **Hybrid Detection**: If regex doesn’t catch it, ML does. Both methods are used on staged diffs via `git diff --cached`.
